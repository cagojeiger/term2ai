This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Term2AI is a Python-based terminal wrapper providing **complete I/O control**, **global input hijacking**, **AI integration**, and **advanced terminal emulation** capabilities. The project implements a multi-layer hijacking architecture for 100% terminal control and follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach with 8 planned checkpoints for incremental feature development.

**Project Status**: Early development phase (Checkpoint 0 complete). Core functionality is planned but not yet implemented.

### Core Hijacking Capabilities
- **Level 1**: PTY-based terminal session control (ptyprocess + blessed)
- **Level 2**: Global input hijacking (keyboard + pynput)
- **Level 3**: Advanced terminal control (blessed fullscreen + cursor management)
- **Complete Integration**: All layers working together for total terminal domination

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles

1. **Context Manager Pattern (RAII)**: All resource management uses Python's context manager protocol (`__enter__`/`__exit__` and `__aenter__`/`__aexit__`) to ensure automatic cleanup and prevent resource leaks.

2. **Test-Driven Development**: Features are implemented following strict TDD - tests are written first, then implementation follows to pass the tests.

3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout with Pydantic models for data validation and mypy for static type checking.

4. **Multi-Layer Hijacking Architecture**: Layered system with complete terminal control:
   - **Level 0**: Operating System (Unix)
   - **Level 1**: PTY Wrapper Core + blessed integration (lowest level)
   - **Level 2**: Global Input Hijacking (keyboard + pynput)
   - **Level 3**: Advanced Terminal Control (blessed fullscreen + UI)
   - **Processing Layer**: ANSI parsing, signal handling, filtering
   - **Feature Layer**: sessions, AI integration, networking
   - **Plugin System**: extensible hijacking capabilities
   - **User Interface Layer**: complete terminal domination

### Key Components (Planned Architecture)

**CompleteHijacker Class** (planned: `src/term2ai/core/complete_hijacker.py`):
- Main hijacking orchestration class with async context manager support
- Must implement `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` for automatic hijacking cleanup
- Integrates all hijacking layers (PTY + Global Input + Terminal Control)

**PTYWrapper Class** (planned: `src/term2ai/core/pty_wrapper.py`):
- Core terminal wrapper with blessed integration and context manager support
- Must implement `__enter__`/`__exit__` for automatic resource cleanup
- Handles process lifecycle, basic I/O, error handling, and terminal control

**GlobalInputHijacker Class** (planned: `src/term2ai/core/global_input.py`):
- Global input hijacking with keyboard + pynput integration
- Must implement async context manager for safe hijacking lifecycle
- Handles system-level keyboard/mouse event capture and analysis

**AsyncIOManager Class** (planned: `src/term2ai/core/async_io.py`):
- Asynchronous I/O operations with async context manager support
- Must implement `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` for async resource management
- Handles non-blocking I/O, multiplexing, timeouts, and hijacked event processing

**SessionManager & SessionContext** (planned):
- Session lifecycle management through context managers
- Automatic session cleanup and persistence handling
- Hijacked data integration and analysis

**ConfigManager & TempConfigContext** (planned):
- Configuration management with temporary override support
- Context manager for temporary config changes that auto-restore
- Hijacking feature configuration and preferences

**Current Implementation Status**: Only basic module structure exists in `src/term2ai/`. Core classes are not yet implemented. The `hello()` function in `src/term2ai/__init__.py` is the only implemented functionality.

### Development Workflow

The project follows a checkpoint-based development approach with detailed specifications in `plan/checkpoints/`. **Current project status: Early development phase with only basic project structure in place.**

**Implementation Status:**
- **Checkpoint 0**: Project setup (‚úÖ Complete)
- **Checkpoint 1**: Basic PTY wrapper + blessed integration (üìã Pending - Next priority)
- **Checkpoint 1.5**: Global hijacking system (keyboard + pynput + blessed) (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 2**: I/O handling + global input integration (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 2.5**: CLI interface (`term2ai` command) (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 3**: Terminal state management (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 4**: Signal handling (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 5**: ANSI parsing (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 6**: Session management (üìã Pending)
- **Checkpoint 7**: Advanced features (üìã Pending)

**Important**: Most core functionality described in this document represents planned architecture, not implemented features. Always check the actual source code in `src/term2ai/` before assuming functionality exists.

**Development Philosophy** (from `plan/roadmap.md`):
- **ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏ Ï£ºÎèÑ Í∞úÎ∞ú**: Tests written first, implementation follows
- **Ï†êÏßÑÏ†Å Í∞úÎ∞ú**: Incremental feature building through checkpoints
- **ÌÉÄÏûÖ ÏïàÏ†ÑÏÑ±**: Pydantic models with comprehensive type hints
- **Î¨∏ÏÑú Ï£ºÎèÑ**: Documentation maintained alongside code

Each checkpoint has specific acceptance criteria including:
- All tests passing (‚â•95% success rate)
- ‚â•90% code coverage for core functionality
- Type checking with mypy
- Linting with ruff
- Context manager implementation and testing
- Resource leak prevention verification

### Critical Implementation Requirements

1. **Context Manager Implementation**: All resource-managing classes MUST implement appropriate context manager protocols to prevent resource leaks.

2. **Exception Safety**: Resource cleanup must be guaranteed even when exceptions occur.

3. **Async Resource Management**: Async operations must use async context managers (`async with`) for proper cleanup.

4. **RAII Pattern**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization - resources are acquired in `__init__` or `__enter__` and automatically released in `__exit__`.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Full workflow testing with real terminals
- **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput verification
- **Resource Safety Tests**: Context manager and exception safety verification

Use pytest markers to categorize tests: `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.e2e`, `@pytest.mark.slow`.

### Documentation

The project maintains comprehensive documentation in `docs/` and `plan/`:
- `docs/api-design.md`: API interfaces and usage patterns with context manager examples
- `docs/architecture.md`: System architecture and design principles including RAII pattern
- `docs/technical-decisions.md`: Technical choices and rationale, including Context Manager vs manual resource management
- `plan/checkpoints/`: Detailed checkpoint specifications with acceptance criteria
- `plan/roadmap.md`: Overall development strategy and milestone tracking

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Always update relevant documentation when implementing features
- Include context manager interfaces and resource management patterns
- Maintain Korean language sections for development philosophy
- Update checkpoint status and acceptance criteria as features are completed
- Update this CLAUDE.md file's "Current Implementation Status" sections as work progresses

### Key Technical Decisions

From `docs/technical-decisions.md`:
- **PTY Library**: Using `ptyprocess` instead of `subprocess` for true terminal emulation
- **Architecture**: Hybrid sync/async approach for progressive complexity
- **Platform**: Unix-only (Linux/macOS) for optimal performance
- **Context Managers**: RAII pattern for all resource management
- **Hijacking Libraries**: `keyboard` + `pynput` + `blessed` for complete terminal control
